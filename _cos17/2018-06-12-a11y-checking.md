## e-tivity 2: Check a Website {#etivity}

1. Join one of the [groups][grps].
2. Pick a website of your choice and pick a random sub page.
3. Read through the [Easy Checks][ezycks].
3. Perform Easy Checks on the page and on the home page of the site.
4. Ask questions in the lectures on **June 19th**.
5. Make notes about the pages.
6. On **June 30**, in Graz, we will walk with each group through the discoveries and learn from each other.
7. I expect that everyone is able to talk about all tested aspects of the site.
