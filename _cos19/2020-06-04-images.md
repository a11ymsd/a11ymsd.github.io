## E-Tivity

Every student picks a conference talk (about 45 minutes) that is summarized in a blog post (about one A4 page long). The main focus of the blog post should be on new learnings and re-enforced views. Summarize briefly and then describe what you learned (or what you feel is missing).

**Please add your pick to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wpMi5pxRc84Z5WPjYA4YYTHTMmqWg085kOb9rAYORwc/edit?usp=sharing).**
