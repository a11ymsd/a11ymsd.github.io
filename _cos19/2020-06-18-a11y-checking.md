## e-tivity 2: Check a Website {#etivity}

1. Join one of the [groups][grps].
2. Pick a website of your choice and pick a random sub page.
3. Read through the [Easy Checks][ezycks] and [my condensed version][ytlcks].
4. Perform Easy Checks on the randomly picked sub page **and** on the home page of the site.
   1. For our meeting on June 25th: Concentrate on the following checks:
      
      * Alternative Text
      * Animated Content
      * Audio
      * Contrasting Colors
      * Headings
      * Page Title
      * Video
      
      We will talk about those issues in the first Q&A.
    2. All other checks I’ll cover in a session at June 25th and then you got time to test that for the report.
5. All the time: Ask questions on Slack.
6. Make notes about the pages.
7. Send in the notes in the [groups spreadsheet][grps] by **July 30**.
8. I’ll review and give feedback in August, hopefully early.
